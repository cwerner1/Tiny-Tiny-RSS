h1. Share anything with tt-rss

Since version:1.6.0 you can share arbitrary stuff to appear as articles in your Published feed (they have no originating feed, so in tt-rss terms technically they are placed into Archived feed and set published). You can share through the bookmarklet provided in Preferences -> Feeds and a separate Android application.

Bookmarklet dialog looks like this:

!http://tt-rss.org/redmine/attachments/download/172/20120909-185014.png!

h2. Sharing from Android

This has been integrated in the tt-rss android client, so the following is obsolete.
