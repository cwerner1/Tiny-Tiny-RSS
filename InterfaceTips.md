Interface Tips
==============

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

-   Keyboard shortcuts help can be displayed by selecting appropriate
    option from main Actions dropdown.
-   Pressing <code>Esc</code> closes active dialog (if any).

Mouse shortcuts
---------------

### Clicking on article headline or title (in combined mode)

-   **Ctrl + Left Click** - open article in a browser tab (background or
    foreground depending on your browser setting)
-   **Left Click** - open article (selects article in combined mode)
-   **Shift + Left Click** - select and mark and read article without
    opening any links under cursor, useful if post itself contains
    something clickable and you just want to quickly mark it as read
-   **Right Click** - open article context menu

### In version:1.7.1 article movement shortcuts are a bit different in combined mode.

-   **n/p** or **up/down** will scroll long posts before switching to
    the next one
-   **Ctrl-up/down** will move between posts like previous versions

Layout
------

-   Type <code>a W</code> to toggle widescreen panel layout. This does
    not work with combined mode.
