Keyboard Shortcuts
==================

A lot of common actions in Tiny Tiny RSS can be performed using keyboard
shortcuts. You can display shortcut help by opening <code>Actions -\>
Keyboard shortcuts</code> dropdown.

Tiny Tiny RSS uses multi-key shortcuts inspired by Emacs prefix
notation. So “c m” means you press “c” and “m” sequentially.

Since version:1.7.0 you can modify hotkey maps using plugins, see
<code>plugins/swap\_jk</code> for an example.
