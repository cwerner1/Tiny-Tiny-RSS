## Contributing code the right way ^(or: how I learned to post merge requests without crying myself to sleep)

1. Post your brilliant idea on the forums, ask to be given developer privileges. Preferably post diffs if you got them. Don't forget to mention your gitlab username.
2. When you have developer privileges you can make branches, check them out, work on them locally, push them back and post merge requests.
3. Usual stuff applies: don't post unrelated issues in one merge request, try to not screw up indenting (tt-rss mostly uses tab characters), try to respect surrounding formatting style, etc.
4. That's it.

You can see an example of the workflow [here](https://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3609&p=21462#p21461).

Questions? Here's the [gitlab-related thread](https://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3432) on the forums.

## Is there a code of conduct?

Yes. If you can help it, don't be an idiot baby.
