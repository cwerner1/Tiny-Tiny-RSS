# How to contribute the right way or merge requests without tears

1. Post your brilliant idea on the forums, ask to be given developer privileges. Preferably post diffs if you got them. Don't forget to mention your gitlab username.
2. When you have developer privileges you can make branches, check them out, work on them locally, push them back and post merge requests.
3. Usual stuff applies: don't post unrelated issues in one merge requests, try to not screw up indenting (tt-rss mostly uses tab characters), try to respect surrounding formatting style, etc.
4. That's it.

Questions? Here's the [gitlab-related thread](https://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3432) on the forums.
