Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

### I’m on a shared hosting, and…

### I’m using some third-party package of tt-rss and/or a third party hosted service

If you didn’t download it yourself from this site and use it on your own
VDS, preferably using Git, nobody here cares about your problems.

Although we do have a [special
subforum](http://tt-rss.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=24) for people with
shared hosting related questions. You can try posting there.

### I’m using lastpass and stuff is broken {#im-using-lastpass-and-stuff-is-broken style="color:red"}

Lastpass arbitrarily breaks tt-rss forms preventing various stuff like
saving settings from functioning properly. Why? Ask lastpass developers.

### I’m experiencing random failures / UI glitches ({[error]({"code":7}}), {[error]({"code":6}}))

Almost every time those are caused by malfunctioning and/or badly
written browser extensions. Always try opening tt-rss without browser
extensions running (i.e. separate Firefox profile, Chrome incognito
mode, etc). This way you will be able to figure out which extension
breaks things.

One of the extensions that causes such problems is Lastpass.

### What should I use - MySQL or PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL should give you much better performance, especially if you
tune it a bit.
