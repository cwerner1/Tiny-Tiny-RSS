Publishing articles
===================

Since version:1.2.14 TT-RSS has support for publishing selected articles
in a special RSS feed, accessible to anyone who knows the special
randomly-generated URL. This works independently of [GeneratedFeeds](GeneratedFeeds).

You can mark articles as published by clicking [standard feed
icon](http://feedicons.com/) near headline title:

![](/images/publish_articles.png)

You can learn your publishing URL to share it with your acquaintances or
generate another URL if necessary on **My Feeds** tab in preferences.

You can also use filter action “Publish article” to publish articles
automatically.
